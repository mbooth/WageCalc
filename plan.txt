Finish payrate.py
24/7/17 - currently implementing shift edit functions within delegate. Copied most
from payratetabledelegate, but some need fixing (including DR/NR to Combo boxes)

To include following functions
    Create Pay Rate
    Delete Pay Rate (To include a check that it's not assigned to a shift)
    Edit Pay Rate

PayRateTable : List of PayRate Objects in DateFrom or PayRateID order
View Table for Pay Rates to include how many shifts are at this pay rate, maybe also total time over this pay rate
Implement payrates into shift object
Edit Shift > Pay Rate to link to a dropdown to payrate list, show a table (ComboBox Delegate)




An Initialise Routine to load all data from file including :
    * Shifts
    * PayRates
    Rotas
    Contracts
    etc

PayRate Object  PayRateID, DateFrom, DateTo, DayRate, NightRate



Shifts > Warning on multiple shifts on one day.
Shifts > Warning on shifts over x length

Shifts > Validation when editing or creating.
    Possibly validation on the objects themselves (as opposed to validating just the input).
    Validate the objects so it happens during import, create, load, save, edit and other manipulation.
    We can make it pretty for edit shift validation by building it the object validation.


Shift > Load : File Requester
Shift > Save : Confirmation Dialog
Date ranges in Edit Shift

Shifts > Sort. Remove button. Implement sorting by column header instead
Shifts > Filter. Implement. (Filter by what? Shift length? Min/max lengths. Pay rate? Date ranges? Move the date bars
        into the filter bar?

Shifts > Change from Import & Replace, to that or Import & Add. Maybe requester after selecting file. "Add or replace?"

SLRate Object   SLRateID, DateFrom, DateTo, DayRate, NightRate
